# A sandbox to try stuff for web development
## Repo: web-dev-tryouts
Some tests with JS, CSS, HTML(5), among others for the Web, this and that. Inspiration and guidance come from a diverse set of sources, from forums, video, tutorials, and own creations.
If it happens the unlikely event that you are reading this, feel free to comment, suggest, or simply try it out by yourself. I do this space just for fun and learn bites of something I am not so familiar with.
